This site is built using my own static site generator using React + Typescript +
CSS-in-JS, but that all compiles to regular HTML and the only JS that runs is
analytics. I like the juxtaposition between relatively advanced tools and the
minimalism of the website. I could have probably used something like
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), but I liked making my own generator. Also I
like how customizable my own solution is. For example

```jsx
// syntax highlighting like this
// is done at generation time on the
// server and I get line numbers with
// css counters targeting DOM like this
<span class="line-number">code</span>
```

I think that's pretty cool.
