This site is built using my own static site generator made with React +
Typescript + CSS-in-JS, and yet it is completely static. I like the
juxtaposition between relatively advanced tools and the minimalism of the
website. I don't necessarily think that it's even overengineered. Other similar
generators, most notably Gatsby, force you into a PWA set up where you have to
have a relatively large JS bundle.

```jsx
// even syntax highlighting like this
// is done at generation time on the
// server and I get line numbers with
// css counters targeting DOM like this
<span class="line-number">code</span>
```

The only JS on the site is to figure out if anyone without an adblocker actually
happens to visit. I think it's pretty cool.
