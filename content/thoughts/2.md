I've experimented a lot with compile-to-js languages, and I've come to the
conclusion that, while they're very cool, they're not worth it if you're working
on something solo; I think TypeScript is more than good enough. I think in the
ideally it makes sense to use one when you have a lot of people of varying skill
levels collaborating on the same large code base, and the time saved in
developer productivity and bug prevention is worth all trouble of learning a new
language, writing bindings, and losing out on a lot of the ecosystem.
