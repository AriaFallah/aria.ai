Between the [rust conf 2018 closing keynote][1], [unity's new ECS system][2],
[Mike Acton's talk on data oriented design][3], just my own general interest in
game programming, and comments on hacker news / reddit, ECS + DOD have become
much more prominent in my life to the point where I feel compelled to try them.
I think there's a lot of lessons I could learn from the concepts and apply
outside of games, and it's an excuse to try and write a game. Right now Unity
seems to be going all in on it ([maybe because Acton works there now][4]) and
they have a huge ecosystem, so I'll use it as my game engine of choice and see
what ends up happening.
