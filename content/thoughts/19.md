Today I read and discussed [this article on cultural appropriation][1] with a
friend, which TL;DR:

- The tension isn’t stemming from the surface act of borrowing from another
  culture; it’s coming from the inequality surrounding it.

- Nowadays a national conversation really means that everyone is participating
  and syndicating their views and opinions about a topic — only the most
  compelling sound bites bubble up and get amplified. And what that means for
  the CA dialogue is that it ends up getting whittled down to “black people are
  saying white people can’t wear cornrows” or “white people can’t wear hoop
  earrings” or white people just have to — as Katy Perry so eloquently put it —
  “stick to baseball and hot dogs.” But that’s not the end goal of calling out
  appropriation. The goal is to make things more fair both on a cultural and
  economic level.

- The reality is when I’m asked ”Can white women wear box braids?“ the answer is
  ”Yes, of course. People can do whatever they want.“ But until things are made
  equal, they’ll be doing it in a context where the people being “appreciated”
  will always express the pain of living in a world that’s not fair.
