I spent my entire weekend playing Red Dead Redemption 2, watching anime, and
watching UFC. I enjoyed my time, but more and more I question the overall value
of what I choose to do with my time. It's not just about how, instead, I could
be learning something new or working out. It's more about the fact that I think
I'm in a relatively good position to create some sort of positive impact in the
world, and I'm not doing that. I don't think this decision makes me a bad or
selfish person, but I still think about it a lot.

Mostly what's stopping me is the logistical overhead. I don't know where or how
to get started. Moreover, there's this dissonance between expressing my desire
to make a positive impact, but simultaneously not really feeling like doing the
hard work necessary to achieve it. It's easier said than done essentially. I'll
see if I figure something out eventually.
