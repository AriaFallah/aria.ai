And what that means for the CA dialogue is that it ends up getting whittled down to “black people are saying white people can’t wear cornrows” or “white people can’t wear hoop earrings” or white people just have to — as Katy Perry so eloquently put it — “stick to baseball and hot dogs.” But that’s not the end goal of calling out appropriation. The goal is to make things more fair both on a cultural and economic level.</p></li><li><p>The reality is when I’m asked ”Can white women wear box braids?“ the answer is ”Yes, of course. People can do whatever they want.“ But until things are made equal, they’ll be doing it in a context where the people being “appreciated” will always express the pain of living in a world that’s not fair.</p></li></ul><p>I find myself reflecting on this article, and on how my views have changed on a wide array of topics over the years.

Previously, since the graphics were done using roughjs, on every animation frame, I was computing the handrawn boxes for every single segment of the snake's body and the food. This was super expensive and caused frame drops when the snake grew to a reasonably large size. Now, before the game even starts, I render 50 handrawn boxes for the food and the snake's body, and then store the pixel data. When it's time to render the snake and food, I just generate a random index and pull the pixel data from the arrays. Thus, there's no need for any expensive computation, and as a result, the game runs much smoother; there's no frame drops even when the snake reaches lengths of over 100.</p></article></div><div class="css-nb8wqx"><a id="2018-10-30T07:37:30.419Z" href="#2018-10-30T07:37:30.419Z" class="css-r4nj4o">[2018-10-30]</a><article class="css-pczpdi"><p>Growing up I was very heavy handedly taught to be humble and respectful, but I wasn't taught to balance it out with just the right amount of shameless self-marketing and priotization of myself over others.
