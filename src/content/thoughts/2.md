I've experimented a lot with compile-to-js languages, and I've come to the
conclusion that, while they're very cool, they're not worth it if you're working
on something solo; I think TypeScript is more than good enough. Ideally it makes
sense to use one when you have a lot of people of varying skill levels
collaborating on the same large code base. In that case, the time saved in
developer productivity and bug prevention might be worth the trouble of learning
a new language, writing bindings, and losing out on a lot of the ecosystem.
