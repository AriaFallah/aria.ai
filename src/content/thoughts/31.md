Claude code is absolutely amazing. Everyone else has covered why already. For me, one huge benefit is that I've always researched a ton before starting projects, but I have nothing to show at the end of it. When I use LLMs as the intermediary for teaching/learning, I can turn those insights into high-quality running code instead of having nothing to show at the end of my question-asking. My job is just to make sure I'm keeping Claude honest.
