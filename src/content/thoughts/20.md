Got a kick out of this image https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/ and the
linked HN discussion https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25240939 since I fall
strongly in the camp of "has a custom static site generator" and "very few blog
posts." I think inherently though I'm fine with that since I used this as a
vehicle for learning rather than some sort of platform I actually want to build
a following on.

At least that's what I'm going to keep telling myself when I decide to rewrite
the generator in rust LOL
