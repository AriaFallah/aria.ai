Programming is both an art form and a means to an end. I have always been
obsessed with the former, and the latter has always been a byproduct. The
existence of this site is a testament to that. The tradeoffs I have made in its
design and creation were not made with my few visitors in mind, but rather were
made just for myself. This form of decision-making is fine for recreation, but I
feel that all programmers including myself are prone to it in more professional
contexts.
