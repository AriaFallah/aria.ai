I spent maybe 1 hour trying to figure out how to make list bullet points play
nicely with a left-floated image while adding a pic of myself to my home page.
Even reading all of this
[insane deep dive](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gap-after-the-list-marker/)
on list markers. Until eventually I realized I could just float the image right
instead of left. Claude says:
