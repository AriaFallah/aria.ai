I was wrong. As annoying as the learning curve for Unity is, rust gamedev is not
close to a place where I can make something I would be proud of. My goal is to
learn about game development, and to make a game. I should not conflate that
goal with wanting to learn a new programming language, or with wanting to avoid
the Unity editor and only writing code.
