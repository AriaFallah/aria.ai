For something sold as super beginner friendly, for me, Unity was anything but
that. I was wrestling with the editor for a while without having written a
single line of meaningful code, which made me feel more like I was learning
something like photoshop rather than making a game.

I'm going to be switching to writing my game with a more barebones approach
using rust and [amethyst](https://www.amethyst.rs/). I'm sure at some point I
will wish I had the tooling in Unity that I'm abandoning, but I think this is
mostly fine since I'm making a 2D game. Moreover, this will be a good
opportunity to write low-level code and finally learn rust. My first impression
of the language is that it's like C++11 and OCaml had a baby, and I like that a
lot.
