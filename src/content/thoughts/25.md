I just added images for the first time to a blog post. It feels so unnecessarily
hard and clunky. To be honest, it's made me want to reach for a CMS for the
first time (also I wonder how many images I can upload to github?). I'll hold
off for now though. I'll just keep experiencing the pain, see if there's
anything off the shelf that does what I want, and if not, I'll build it myself
:D
