I just optimized [my snake game](https://www.aria.ai/snake) a bit, and I'm very
happy with the results. Previously, since the graphics were done using roughjs,
on every animation frame, I was computing the handrawn boxes for every single
segment of the snake's body and the food. This was super expensive and caused
frame drops when the snake grew to a reasonably large size. Now, before the game
even starts, I render 50 handrawn boxes for the food and the snake's body, and
then store the pixel data. When it's time to render the snake and food, I just
generate a random index and pull the pixel data from the arrays. Thus, there's
no need for any expensive computation, and as a result, the game runs much
smoother; there's no frame drops even when the snake reaches lengths of
over 100.
