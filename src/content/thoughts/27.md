I've been going to a boxing class for a few months now on and off. One thing I
learned very quickly is that I am not built for fighting. Sure I think I am
pretty good at the actual technique part, but when I sparred for my one and only
time, I went home with a headache for the next few hours and realized there were
real, unpleasant physical consequences to my choice of pastime. I thought I was
some sort of tough guy, but I've realized that I am just not willing to pay the
cost of being tough. I have too much on the line.
