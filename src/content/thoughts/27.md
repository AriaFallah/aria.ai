I've been going to a boxing class for a few months now on and off. One thing I
learned very quickly is that I am not built for fighting. Sure I think I am
pretty good at the actual technique part, but when I sparred for my one and only
time – just light jabs only – I got hit with a double jab. Unlike the single
ones before, it _hurt_. The combination of already being stunned and not
expecting another punch felt like it 10x'd the damage. I went home with a
headache for the next few hours and realized there were real, unpleasant
physical consequences to my choice of pastime. I thought I was some sort of
tough guy, but I've realized that I am just not willing to pay the cost of being
tough. I have too much on the line.
