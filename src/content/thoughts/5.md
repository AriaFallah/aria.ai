A lot of times I don't share my opinions for fear of not having fleshed them out
enough. I try to avoid making wrong assumptions, sounding pretentious, or
whatever else. That's part of the reason this section exists. I reckon basically
no one will read it so I'm free to be a bit more reckless with whatever's on my
mind.
