I never did end up making that game. I didn't have the passion to make time for
it in my day. There's a lot of tech that, similar to games, I feel an initial
impulse to learn, but they're just too much work. This isn't a comprehensive
list, but off the top of my head

**Low level programming**

- SIMD
- Better understanding how linux/windows work at a low level and how to develop
  for them as platforms.
- Network protocol implementations e.g. how HTTP/2 works.

**Devops / infra / architecture**

- Terraform, docker, kubernetes, envoy / linkerd, vault, consul, etcd, and so
  much more.
- So many tools and buzzwords. How do people actually build things that scale.
  How to architect and manage SQL DBs. Authorization. Monolith vs SOA. What's
  the point of Kafka lol.

**Graphics**

- OpenGL / Vulkan / whatever
- Physically based rendering

**Parsing**

- Actually writing some grammar and then a recursive descent parser for it
- Learning more about macro systems in programming languages
  - Babel macros for JS
  - OCaml PPXs
  - Hygenic macros for Rust

and not worth another category, but I'd like to learn more about CRDTs.
