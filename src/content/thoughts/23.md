Things I am currently interested in learning more about:

- [Local-first development](https://localfirstweb.dev/), which seems to be an
  evolution of me saying I wanted to learn more about CRDTs a long time ago.
  https://electric-sql.com/ seems like the most interesting/promising. Other
  tangentially related ones that have caught my eye https://www.powersync.com/
  https://ditto.live/ https://zerosync.dev/. In terms of a shift of It seems
  like people are moving more in a "sync-engine" direction now.
- Distributed Systems e.g. consistency https://jepsen.io/consistency and
  whatever else. I've read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" and to be
  honest it was a little high level for me. I want more implementation-level
  knowledge...or maybe I'm misremembering the book.
- Systems Programming
  - Refreshing operating systems knowledge
  - Learning more about profiling
  - Maybe learning some Zig since people are hyping that up

To this end, I've also bought some books that I'm planning on reading. Although
I probably should pair them with projects or something so I actually take them
in. In the order I'm most interested in reading:

- [Database Internals](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Internals-Deep-Distributed-Systems/dp/B0BQZDLK38/)
- [Systems Performance](https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Performance-Brendan-Gregg/dp/0136820158)
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Three-Easy-Pieces/dp/198508659X/)
- [High Performance Browser Networking](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Browser-Networking-performance/dp/1449344763/)
