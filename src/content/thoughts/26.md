Thinking back to how in high school I drew out
[an 8 bit adder](https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter14/), copying what I had
seen in the
[Code book](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0137909101).
It's not so complex of a thing, but I have no recollection of how it works now
and I find it really impressive that I actually did that. I remember proudly
showing it to different people â€“ most memorably, we had relatively kind and open
gym teachers who were very accepting so I felt like they might appreciate it...
but they thought I was just drawing dicks ðŸ˜”.

I bring this all up because I just saw an AND gate in a meme, and I, like my gym
teachers who I thought were really dumb at the time, also thought for a moment
that I was looking at a dick.
