Growing up I was very heavy handedly taught to be humble and respectful, but I
wasn't taught to balance it out with just the right amount of shameless
self-marketing and priotization of myself over others. This went hand-in-hand
with also learning to understand my own worth, and asserting it when it was
called into question. I think these are important lessons to learn and teach in
moderation.
