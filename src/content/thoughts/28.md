I've always believed in the idea of calories-in/calories-out (CICO) for weight
loss. But for a while I've felt that that it isn't the full picture for me me.
Not that I'm not able to lose weight by tracking calories, but there have been
periods of time where I've been in the gym for an hour 4-6 days a week and I'm
eating ~2000cal or less as a 5'10 200lb man and I lose weight at less than a
rate of 1lb/week. Which I know inherently sounds ridiculous so I have trouble
believing it myself. I wish I could say I have the data to back it up, but with
calorie tracking I've always done it for only a short while to get the gist of
what I'm eating and then stopped.

But just today I have installed https://macrofactorapp.com/ after slowly gaining
~10-15lbs over the past 9 months and am going to hold myself to tracking as
diligently as possible for the next 6 months. With my newfound executive
function, I'll finally crack the code and either make a blog post titled "I was
wrong about weight loss" or "CICO doesn't work as well for me as it should"
