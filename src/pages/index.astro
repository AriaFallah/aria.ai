Hi I'm Aria! Welcome to my website :)

* I'm currently living 6-year-old me's dream of being a "computerist."
* My hobbies are reading/watching interesting things online, programming,
  cooking, fitness, outdoorsy stuff, and photography.
* I currently work at Meta: I spent my first 3 years at Facebook on a startup-like
  product team doing full-stack development in Hack/JS, the next 3 years at
  WhatsApp on a small infrastructure/devtools team writing mostly cross-platform
  Rust, and recently I've started working at Instagram on an infrastructure team
  measuring/optimizing backend performance.

You can find me on:
* [Github](https://github.com/AriaFallah) where I have a few projects I'm proud of.
  Notably my [C++ CSV parser](https://github.com/AriaFallah/csv-parser), my [snake game](https://github.com/AriaFallah/aria.ai/tree/master/snake)
  written in [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) [(play here)](/snake/), an [OCaml PPX for template strings](https://github.com/AriaFallah/ppx_str)
  and my [outdated Webpack Tutorial](https://github.com/AriaFallah/WebpackTutorial)
  that somehow got 2200 stars and was translated into Chinese and Korean.
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3772221) where I've allegedly
  "reached 2m" people with 152 questions and 137 answers.
* [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ariafallah), which I don't take so seriously,
  but it is true that my real title at work is "Chief VP, Worse Engineering"
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/m0meni), where for now I just retweet things I
  find interesting or funny. My ["tweets" are here](/thoughts/).

Fun facts about me:
* I sleep in a hammock every night.
* I have driven across the entire USA east to west twice, and up and down both the
  east/west coasts.
* If I wasn't a software engineer, I'd probably have tried to be a doctor of some
  sort. I am very intrigued by the medical field, and, if AI steals my job, plan B
  is to become a physical therapist.
