Hi I'm Aria! Welcome to my website :)

* I'm currently living 6-year-old me's dream of being a "computerist."
* My hobbies are reading/watching interesting things online, programming,
  cooking, fitness, outdoorsy stuff, teaching, and photography.
* I currently work at Meta: I spent my first 3 years at Facebook on a startup-like
  product team doing full-stack development in Hack/JS, the next 3 years at
  WhatsApp on a small infrastructure/devtools team writing mostly cross-platform
  Rust, and recently I've started working at Instagram on an infrastructure team
  measuring/optimizing backend performance.

You can find me on:
* [Github](https://github.com/AriaFallah) where I have a few projects I'm proud of.
  Notably my [C++ CSV parser](https://github.com/AriaFallah/csv-parser), my [snake game](https://github.com/AriaFallah/aria.ai/tree/master/snake)
  written in [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) [(play here)](/snake/), an [OCaml PPX for template strings](https://github.com/AriaFallah/ppx_str)
  and my [outdated Webpack Tutorial](https://github.com/AriaFallah/WebpackTutorial)
  that somehow got 2200 stars and was translated into Chinese and Korean.
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3772221) where I've allegedly
  "reached 2m" people with 152 questions and 137 answers.
* [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ariafallah), which I don't take so seriously,
  but it is true that my real title at work is "Chief VP, Worse Engineering"
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aria0ai), where for now I just retweet things I
  find interesting or funny. My "tweets" [are here](/thoughts/).

Notable Blog Posts:
* [Why Use Flow (2016)](/blog/why-use-flow/)
* [Storing Secrets Using the MacOS Keychain CLI](/blog/storing-secrets-with-keychain/)

Fun facts about me:
* [I sleep in a hammock every night](/blog/i-sleep-in-a-hammock-every-night/)
* I have driven across the entire USA east to west twice, and up and down both the
  east/west coasts.
* If I wasn't a software engineer, I'd probably have tried to be a doctor of some
  sort. Medicine/helping people is very cool to me, and, if AI steals my job,
  plan B is to become a physical therapist because becoming a doctor would take
  too long.
* I went [freediving in cenotes](https://cenotefreediving.com/) recently, and it's
  probably the coolest thing I've ever done. I was able to go down about 23m pretty
  comfortably after the course, and I plan to go back and try to improve.
